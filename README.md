# Foundry ERC20 Project

This project implements an **ERC20 token** called **SanToken** using **Foundry**, a fast and modular toolkit for Ethereum smart contract development. The token is deployed on a testnet and is intended for **learning and experimentation purposes**. It demonstrates the implementation of the ERC20 standard and includes testing, deployment, and interaction scripts.

## About Foundry

**Foundry** is a modern toolkit for Ethereum development that helps you build, test, deploy, and interact with smart contracts quickly and efficiently.

### Foundry Tools
- **Forge**: A testing framework for Solidity contracts.
- **Cast**: A command-line tool for interacting with contracts.
- **Anvil**: A local Ethereum node for development and testing.
- **Chisel**: A Solidity REPL for quick prototyping and debugging.

For more details, check out the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

## Foundry Commands

Here are some useful commands to manage the project using **Foundry**:

### Run Tests
Execute the test suite:
```sh
forge test
```

### Create a Snapshot
Save the current contract state:
```sh
forge snapshot
```

### Format Code
Format Solidity source files:
```sh
forge fmt
```

### Deploy and Verify the Contract
Deploy and verify the token contract using a deployment script:
```sh
forge script script/DeploySanToken.s.sol:DeploySanToken --rpc-url <SEPOLIA_RPC_URL>  --account <ACCOUNT> --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> -vvvv
```

### Deploy the Contract
Deploy the token contract using a deployment script:
```sh
forge script script/DeploySanToken.s.sol:DeploySanToken --rpc-url <NETWORK_RPC> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

### Verify on Etherscan
Verify the deployed contract:
```sh
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 --num-of-optimizations 200 --watch --constructor-args <ARGS> --etherscan-api-key <YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY> --compiler-version <COMPILER_VERSION> <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> src/SanToken.sol:SanToken
```


## Makefile Commands

The Makefile included in this project simplifies many tasks. Here are the available commands:

### General Commands
- **help**: Displays usage instructions and examples for deploying and funding the contract.
- **all**: Runs a sequence of tasksâ€”cleans compiled files, removes installed modules, installs dependencies, updates them, and builds the project.
- **clean**: Removes all compiled files using `forge clean`.
- **remove**: Deletes installed modules and resets module configurations.
- **install**: Installs the required dependencies using `forge install`.
- **update**: Updates all project dependencies using `forge update`.

### Compilation and Testing
- **build**: Compiles the smart contracts with `forge build`.
- **test**: Runs all tests with `forge test`.
- **snapshot**: Takes a snapshot of the current contract state using `forge snapshot`.
- **format**: Formats the Solidity code according to standard style rules with `forge fmt`.

### Local Blockchain (Anvil)
Start a local blockchain node (Anvil) with preset settings:
```sh
anvil -m 'test test test test test test test test test test test junk' --steps-tracing --block-time 1
```
This command allows you to deploy and interact with contracts on a local test network.

### Deployment and Verification
- **deploy**: Deploys the SanToken contract using a deployment script. It accepts network arguments.  
  Example for deploying on the Sepolia network:
  ```sh
  make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
  ```

- **verify**: Verifies the deployed contract on Etherscan by providing details like chain ID, optimization count, and constructor arguments.



This project is a practical example of creating an ERC20 token with Foundry. The provided Makefile commands streamline your workflow, making it easier to build, test, deploy, and manage your project. Enjoy coding and learning with SanToken!
